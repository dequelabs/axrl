        <h1>Accessibility Reporting Language</h1>
        <p>
          Accessibility Reporting Language (AXRL) is a data
          format designed to describe accessibility tests
          for Web pages, Native apps and other software.
          AXRL is designed to be a flexible and extendable
          data format. AXRL is designed as a JSON format,
          although because it is based on semantic web
          technologies, it could also be expressed in other
          formats.
        </p>
        <p>
          AXRL will include classes for the following
          platforms:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Web / HTML</li>
          <li>Android</li>
          <li>iOS</li>
          <li>Windows (future)</li>
          <li>PDF (future)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Example: A basic web page test</h2>
        <p>
          This example shows the test for example.com, where
          the test produced 2 results. One of the results is
          "failed", and the second is "passed".
        </p>
